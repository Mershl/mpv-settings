# mpv-settings
basically my settings for MPV (Windows/Mac/Linux Compatible)

# Installation
Depending on your Operating System, you need to place the stuff inside the zip in a certain directory.
The root directory needs to look like this:

->mpv

-->input.conf

-->mpv.conf

--->shaders

--->script-opts

--->scripts

you need to rename the proper mpv.conf you want to use to mpv.conf, as i split the different OS' Profiles to avoid errors.

# WINDOWS INSTALLATION
"C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\mpv"

# MAC INSTALLATION
Path:

/USERNAME/.config/mpv

Tested Apple Devices:

- Base Macbook Pro 2018 13"

macOS 11 Big Sur is not tested yet - just in case don't download it as i cannot guarantee that everything works fine.

# LINUX INSTALLATION
Path:
Newly created Linux installs from master use /home/user/.mpv instead of the old /home/user/.config/mpv
