# mpv-settings
basically my settings for MPV (Windows/Mac/Linux Compatible)

# Installation
Depending on your Operating System, you need to place the stuff inside the zip in a certain directory.
The root directory needs to look like this:

You will have more than one mpv config in your folder. Rename the one you want to use to mpv.conf.
